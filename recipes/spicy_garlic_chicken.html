        <h2>Description (should this heading be smaller?)</h2>
        <p>This spicy garlic and mustard chicken will knock your socks off.</p>
        <p>I've grilled this bad boy a number of times and have never been disappointed. Neither will you!</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>0.5 cup Mayonnaise</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon Yellow Mustard</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon Lime Juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>4 teaspoon Minced Garlic</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Chili Garlic Sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Honey</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon Black Pepper</li>
            <li>1.5 pound Chicken Breast</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add all ingredients except the chicken to a medium bowl and whisk to combine.</li>
            <li>Transfer the marinade mixture to a large ziptop plastic bag, add the chicken, seal, and squish contents around to evenly coat the chicken.</li>
            <li>Place bag in the fridge to marinate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill to medium-high heat (or indoor grill pan) and grill the chicken for about 7 minutes, or until done; flip intermittently to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Optionally garnish with fresh herbs and serve with reserved marinade, if desired.</li>
            <li>If desired, before transferring the marinade to a ziptop bag, you can reserve about 1/4 cup to serve as a dipping sauce for the finished chicken.</li>
        </ol>
